      "history": [
        "The founding chapter of DawProtectora tells the story of a group of compassionate souls, each with their unique background, but all bound by an unyielding love for animals. As they witnessed the plight of abandoned and mistreated creatures, a collective determination ignited within them to make a tangible difference. Under the Iberian sun, the founders united in purpose, and DawProtectora was born â€“ a sanctuary, a refuge, a promise to those who had been left behind.",
        "Today, DawProtectora stands as a testament to the unwavering belief that every creature deserves love, respect, and a chance to thrive. The once-small endeavor has grown into a symbol of hope, a place where stories of rescue, recovery, and adoption continue to be written every day. DawProtectora remains committed to the timeless mission of providing a haven for the vulnerable and a voice for the voiceless, ensuring that the enchanting landscapes of Lleida echo with the joyous barks, purrs, and chirps of those who have found their forever homes."
